# twizzle
Twizzle is an experiment with the WordPress REST API. It is intended to be used in conjunction with the VIP Workshop VM, so you'll need to make some changes to use it 'stand-alone'.

Once you've cloned this repo locally;

- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- Access http://vip-workshop.dev:3030/

If you'd like to change the site that posts are being loaded from, then just change the URL on line 37 of `www/twizzle.js`.
